## About
The Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by Ascenderâ€™s Steve Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a set of system fonts for its Android platform. The goal was to provide optimal quality and comfort on a mobile handset when rendered in application menus, web browsers and for other screen text. It consists of Droid Serif, Droid Sans and Droid Sans Mono.
