# Merriweather and MerriweatherSans

## About
Merriweather features a very large x height, slightly condensed letterforms, a mild diagonal stress, sturdy serifs and open forms. The Sans family closely harmonizes with the weights and styles of the serif family. There are four weights and italics for each.

Designed by Eben Sorkin, of Sorkin Type, a type design foundry based in Western Massachaussets, USA.
