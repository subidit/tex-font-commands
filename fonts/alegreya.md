## About
The Alegreya fonts are designed by Juan Pablo del Peral for Huerta Tipogr√°fica. Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. It conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of long texts. The italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the roman. Bold, black, small caps and five number styles are available.
