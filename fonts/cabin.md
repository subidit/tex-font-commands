## About
Cabin is a humanist sans with four weights and true italics and small capitals. According to the designer, Pablo Impallari, Cabin was inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans.

The Cabin font family comes in two variable fonts that includes a Condensed version, four weights plus true italics. The weight distribution is almost monotone, although top and bottom curves are slightly thin. Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded and optically adjusted.
